## `broccoli-scss-lint`

Requires `ruby` and fails with `Error: "ruby" does not exist in the system. Please install "ruby".` when it is not available.

_Hint: use [RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) for Windows._

Next one is `Error: "scss-lint" does not exist in the system. Please install "scss-lint" (gem install scss-lint).`
